### Vision & Next Steps

In our proposal, we planed to make the app with multiple pages but we decide to squish every thing in one page for now and implement this for the next milestone.
 
### Bugs

### Changes since proposal

We decide to abandon the subpage which shows the global trends and relations between factors. Since we think that the users of our app are more cared about the trends and relations within a specific country. Another thing we have changed is that we changed the slider of "Suicide Rate" to "Suicide Total" because the "Suicide Rate" is acutally a very small number and it cannot represent any fact by itself.

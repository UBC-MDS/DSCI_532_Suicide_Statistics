# Milestone 4: Last Improvement
#### Changes Implemented
We decided to improve our plots by using plotly. This change was fairly straightforward to make as well as added significant improvements to the readability of our charts through tooltips. With more time we would have spent some time improving the work flow of our application, guiding users through the decision making process instead of just presenting data. Throughout this process we also improved our documentation by modifying the README to be more succint.

#### Again from Scratch
Making the app again from scratch we would likely focus more on the workflow. Right now our plots are somewhat sporatic and there's no obvious flow to using it. Attempts would be made to reach out to Mental Health Organizations in order to find out which factors truly influence their decision making process. We would also put more work into the map, getting it working and regionize areas of each country to highlight locations with high suicide rates and provide more granularity. 

#### Challenges
We faced issues implementing GeoJSON with Leaflet as the initial GeoJSON we chose was too granular leading to very slow loading times. There was also some minor issues with adjusting to plotly as it required some layout changes that we did not expect.
